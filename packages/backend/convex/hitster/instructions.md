ORIGINAL

Listen to over 100 years of music while guessing when these songs were released. You don’t need to know the exact year* – only if it’s before, after or in between the songs that are on your timeline. Your chances of winning increase if you can also name the artists and song titles.

*The year given on each card is the year that the song was released or performed in public by that artist in its original form.
Preparation:

    Decide if you’re playing in teams or individually.
    Each player/team receives 2 HITSTER tokens and 1 music card which they place face up (date side up) in front of them to start their timeline.
    Choose a DJ. Using Spotify Premium, the DJ can play along! When using Spotify Free, one player plays the DJ or players must take turns scanning the cards to play a song. When using another music streaming service, one player plays the DJ or players must take turns selecting the song on the card manually.

1. Scan

The DJ scans the card using the HITSTER app and follows the on-screen instructions. A song should start playing.
2. Place

Position the music card: The player to the left of the DJ positions the card face down (without peeking at the underside) in the correct spot on their timeline by placing it to the left/right or in between the other music cards in front of them, with the earliest song on their left.
3. Flip

Flip the music card: If it is in the correct position, they get to keep the card. Otherwise, discard it unless another player has correctly placed a HITSTER token (see HITSTER tokens below). Cards of the same year can be in either order, even when that song was released earlier in that year. Now the DJ plays a new song and it’s the next player’s turn.
4. Win

Play continues to the left until one of the players has 10 cards correctly positioned in their timeline. That player is the winner of the game and earns the title of HITSTER!
HITSTER TOKENS

Remember the HITSTER tokens? These are added into the mix for an even more exciting game. These tokens can be used in 3 different ways:
1. On your turn

Don’t know the song? Pay 1 HITSTER token and scan the next card to start a new song and discard the token and the card into the box.
2. On an opponent’s turn

Think that the player has placed a card incorrectly on their timeline? Then shout “HITSTER”, before that card is revealed. Place 1 of your tokens on your opponent’s timeline where you think that the card should go. If you are correct, you get to steal that card. Place it in the correct position on your timeline. Discard any used tokens into the box.

Note: The first player to shout HITSTER gets to place their token first. However if the next player to shout HITSTER thinks that answer is also incorrect, he/she can choose another position on their opponent’s timeline to try to steal the card. No two tokens can be placed on the same spot of the opponent’s timeline.
3. Anytime

Trade 3 HITSTER tokens for the top music card from the deck and place it on your timeline, without having to guess its release date.
Earning HITSTER tokens

On your turn, you can earn 1 HITSTER token if you can correctly name the song’s title and the artist’s name. A token can be earned even when misplacing that card on your timeline. No player can hold more than 5 tokens at any given time during the game.
PRO
Listen to over 100 years of music while guessing when these songs were released. As a PRO you must be able to name the artist AND the song’s title. However you don’t need to know the exact year the song was released – only if it’s before, after or in between the songs that are already on your timeline.
Follow the ORIGINAL game rules with these exceptions:

    Each PRO player receives 5 HITSTER tokens instead of 2.
    In addition to placing a music card in the correct position on their timeline, PRO players must correctly name the artist and the title of the song to win the card.
    Use the HITSTER tokens as per the ORIGINAL rules, but with the difference that you also need to correctly name the artist and the song’s title to steal the card. You also get to keep your token if your steal was successful. No new tokens can be earned while playing as a PRO.

Play continues to the left until one of the players has 10 cards correctly positioned in their timeline.
EXPERT
Listen to over 100 years of music while guessing when these songs were released. As an EXPERT you must be able to name the artist, the song’s title AND the exact year the song was released.
Follow the ORIGINAL game rules with these exceptions:

    Each EXPERT player receives 3 HITSTER tokens instead of 2.
    In addition to placing a music card in the correct position on the timeline, EXPERT players must correctly name the exact year that the song was released, the artist and the title of the song to win the card.
    Use the HITSTER tokens as per the ORIGINAL rules, but with the difference that you also need to correctly name the year the song was released, the artist and the song’s title to steal the card. You also get to keep your token if your steal was successful. No new tokens can be earned while playing as an EXPERT.

Play continues to the left until one of the players has 10 cards correctly positioned in their timeline.
COOPERATIVE
Fancy a less competitive trip down memory lane? Then HITSTER can also be played as one team. Listen to over 100 years of music while guessing when these songs were released. You don’t need to know the exact year* – only if it’s before, after or in between the songs that are on your timeline.
Follow the ORIGINAL game rules with these exceptions:

    Form a team and take 5 HITSTER tokens and 1 card from the deck and place it face up in front of you to start your the timeline.
    Take a card from the box and together with your team try to place it in the correct spot on your the timeline.
    Then flip over the card to check if you were correct. If so, you get to keep the card, otherwise discard it into the box and lose one of your HITSTER tokens.
    Try to collect 10 cards on your the timeline before you run out of HITSTER tokens.

TIP: You can reduce the number of tokens for a more challenging game or set a target high score by trying to collect as many cards as you can before you run out of tokens.
